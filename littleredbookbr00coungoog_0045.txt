volume it will be apparent how redolent the Little Red Book is of
the lile of the citizens of Bristol in the 14th and esth centurias, how
from its peges may be gathmed a picture of the occupatione and
prmuits of the inhabitants, end of the similarity and dissiruilarity¹
between the faido and fallings oi people of the roth oenouy end oi
mose'who lived hom four to live hundred-years ago as portrayed by
the ordinantes oi the Common Council.

In addition to its historic value the Engdsh documento contained

Tio Little Red Book of Bristol is e magnificent specimen osa
class of recordo, many of which through carelessness and want of
appmcletion heve fallen into decoy or cre lost. It is in e puiset
state of preservation, the paper firm to the touch, the script clear to
the eye, and, unforeseen accident alone exceptsd, there is no reason
why its future custodian may not find the volume in almost as perfect
a condition five hundred years hence, as it uas lest by its originator

upwrrds of five hundred years ogo.
