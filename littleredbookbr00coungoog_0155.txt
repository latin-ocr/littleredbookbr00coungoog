to be cited to appear at Glouces-

Bishop of Worcester, to the infrac-

of liberty of the town it is pro-

town¹]. In confirmation of which
article Robert, formerly Arch-
bishop of Canterbury, gave to
the aforesaid Commonalty his
letters signed with his seal

Commonalty. And the said

Richard for that trespass found
sureties, viz. Robert de Lincolne

and Hugh Payn3 and it was ι

iudged by the Commonality, an'd

by the consent of the said
Richard, that if he should here-
after be convicted of the trespass
aforesaid he be put out of the
liberty for ever unless he should
have another grace
