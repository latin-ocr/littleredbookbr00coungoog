some of the ordinenoes have not beccum antiquated by the lapse of
ages. They bear on the conduct of the citizens, the duties cf tho officials,
the adulteration of food, trade, the closing cf public houseo, the residence
of strangers within the town, persuum wandering about aster cuffew without

a light, dogs at large, weges and sanitm matters.

In addition to the above we have a record of the ordinances
issued by the Common Council irom timeto time. In 1439 (1., p. 86)
Ifishmen begotten and born within tho country of Ireland were deharred
from admission to the Common Council, which resolution the craft of

Hoopers endorsed the same year by an ordinance against the employ-
ment oi rebels cf 11111111, calling upon all connected with their craft
“to voyde all such Iryssch seruauntz.”' Other ordinanoes relate to the
punishment oi those betrayiug the cnunsel of the Commonalty (L, p. 104),
cf townsmen refusing to attend when summoned to hear proclamatione
(1., p. 105), of those who slander members ci the Council (L, p. 149),
and of those leaving the town without permission just before Michaclmas
(the day of the election cf Officers) (ΙΙ, p. 46); others relate to admission
to the 1111111111 (Π, pp. 47, 61), and to the protection of the 1111111 of
Chantry lands (ΙΙ, p. 62); and a stringent order regnatas the liveries of
the officials in order to counterect the abusos that had ariscn in connection
with the 11111 (11.,p. 64), wherein the list of those who are entitled to
1111 the town livery is strictly defined. Many other equally important
ordinanoes are to be found in the volume, and 1 quit this 116111 by
calling special attention to an ordinante made in 1381for the saie keepiug
cf all records, papers and muniments touching the commum (1., p. 111).
